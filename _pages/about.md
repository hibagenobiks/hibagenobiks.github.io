I am a researcher in **neurogenomics** with a strong interest in the genetic architecture of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. I currently work at the Centre for Brain Research, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), where I am leading the analyses for India's largest whole-genome sequencing study on Parkinsonâ€™s disease, which aims to sequence 1000 PD cases all acroos the country. My work includes identifying novel pathogenic variants, and conducting rare variant burden tests, and performing meta-analyses with ieuropean cohorts. I am particularly interested in the role of non-coding regulatory regions in brain-related disorders and the integration of genetic, neuroimaging, and environmental data to better understand disease mechanisms.

excerpt: 'This study represents one of the first WGS-based genetic investigations of PD in India with both EOPD and LOPD cases. Novel variants in PRKN, GBA1, LRRK2, ATXN2 and SNCA point to the presence of population-specific variants, and reinforce the importance of genetic studies in diverse populations.'
